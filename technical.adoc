== Technologies Used

=== Backend:

* **'Flask'**: Python web framework for building web applications.
* **'SQLite'**: Lightweight database for storing application data.

=== Frontend:

* **'HTML/CSS'**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
* **'JavaScript`**`: For adding interactivity to the user interface.

== Application Structure

The application is organized into the following components:

* **'app.py'**: Main Flask application file containing the routes, logic, and database interactions.
* **'templates/'**: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering the user interface.
* **'static/'**: Directory containing static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
* **'strength.py'**: Module containing functions for calculating strength scores and percentiles.
* **'database.py'**: Module containing functions for interacting with the SQLite database.

== Database Schema

The application uses a SQLite database with the following tables:

* **'users'**: Stores user information like username, password, and optional profile data.
* **'exercises'**: Stores a list of exercises with their muscle group and targeted muscle information.
* **'workouts'**: Stores workout records for each user, including the date and exercises performed.

== Functionality

The Workout Tracker application provides the following features:

* **'User Authentication'**: Users can register and log in securely using usernames and passwords.
* **'Workout Tracking'**: Users can record and view their workouts, including the date and exercises performed.
* **'Exercise List'**: Users can browse a list of exercises categorized by muscle group and targeted muscle.
* **'Strength Tracking'**: Users can input their workout data to calculate estimated one-rep maximums and strength scores based on gender and body weight.

== Future Plans

Here are some potential future enhancements for the Workout Tracker application:

* **'Progress Tracking'**: Implement a progress page to visualize workout history and track improvements over time.

* **'User Profile Page`**`: Add a user profile page where users can manage their information and view their workout statistics.

== Code

ALL THE CODE FRAGMENTS WILL BE ADDED AS SOON AS I FINISH THEM FULLY.
